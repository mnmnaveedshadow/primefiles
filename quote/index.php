          Lift Freight Services acts only as a ‘forwarder’ within the meaning of

          transportation related terms are used including, but not exclusively;
          transport, carrier & freight. In all rates, a freight forwarder's
          commission rate due to intermedion is included, unless mentioned
          separately. Our liability is exclusively governed by the Dutch
          Forwarding Conditions 2018 and not by any transport law regulation.
          All our (other) services, such as storage, value added services and
          customs formalities, are subject to the aforementioned Dutch
          Forwarding Conditions (with the exception of Article 23). These
          conditions can be found at our website or the Fenex website. General
          terms and conditions of our customers are hereby expressly rejected.

      <h3 class="text-success fw-bold my-4 text-center">Terms and Condition</h3>
      <p>
        The rates quoted herein are based on the information provided by the
        Customer and on the acceptance, equipment & space availability of Ocean
        Carriers/Airlines and any other subcontracted partners of Lift Freight
        Services BV. Therefore, rates are subject to change based on
        availability at the time of booking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, all information provided to Lift Freight Services BV by the
        Customer is subject to validation by Lift Freight Services BV or its
        subcontractors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lift Freight Services BV and/or its subcontractors reserve the rights to
        re-measure or re-weigh any cargo provided to Lift Freight Services BV.
        Any deviations may result in a change to this quote. If the Customer
        becomes aware of any changes in either the weight, commodity or
        dimensions, Lift Freight Services BV needs to be notified immediately as
        this may affect the quoted rates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mentioned exchange rate is for calculation purpose only and therefore no
        rights can be derived from it. The B/L date is leading in regard to the
        charged ocean freight. Marine insurance is not issued unless written to
        do so. Any insurance quotes provided herein shall not be binding unless
        a separate insurance certificate has been provided to the Customer.
      </p>
      <p>
        For all Seafreight LCL shipments, unless otherwise specified locally:
        Lift Freight Services BV rates are based on per CBM or per KGS,
        whichever is higher. The weight and volume will be converted to freight
        ton for the purpose of this quote. Minimum calculation is 1 cbm or 1
        ton.
      </p>
      <p>
        For all Airfreight quotes, Lift Freight Services BV will apply the
        dimensional or volume weight factor according to IATA standards.
        Whichever weight is higher between the gross and the volume/dimensional
        weight of the shipment will become the chargeable weight for purposes of
        the quote. All per kg/lbs rates in the quote are based on the chargeable
        weight. Imperial shipping factor examples: 166 in3/lb = 10.4 lb/ft3 ;
        Metric shipping factor examples: 6000 cm³/kg = 166.667 kg/m³
      </p>
      <p>
        All quotes may have additional charges and fees including but not
        limited to accessorial charges, duties, taxes, storage charges, trucker
        waiting times, demurrage, GRIs (General Rate Increases), new surcharges
        or any other carrier (e.g. airline, ocean line, trucker etc.) related
        charges that are beyond the control of Lift Freight Services BV.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lift Freight Services acts only as a ‘forwarder’ within the meaning of
        Section 8:60 of the Dutch Civil Code, regardless of how we are
        identified on any document (by a third party) and whether transportation
        related terms are used including, but not exclusively; transport,
